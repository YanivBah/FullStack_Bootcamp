# 2.1 - File System

Now we know how to create, write and append text to an existing file using the
fs module, lets do the following:

1. Create a new txt file using the same fs module method we have learned before.

2. Create a copy of the newly created txt file using a method from the fs
   module.

3. Rename one of the files using a method from the fs module.

4. Get a list of all the file names of the current directory using a method from
   the fs module.

5. Find out and implement another method for the fs module.
