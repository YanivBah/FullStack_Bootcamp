We want to use [this API](https://api.chucknorris.io/) to get awesome Chuck
Norris jokes.

1/ Get a random joke each time you click on a button and display the joke on the
screen. 2. Display different joke categories on the screen. When the user
clickâ€™s on a specific category, display a joke from that specific category.

### Ninja
